The "documentation.pdf" file is our documentation for this Saturday submission.

As our website have three section, the files index.html, map_interaction.html and analysis.html corresponds to each of them.

For most part of visualization, we took 5 main types of building types with in recent 9 years (2010 - 2018)

There are three webpages in our website.

The first page is for overview of the registered buildings in recent year. It has a slide bar which allows the user to view the patterns of buildings in recent years. 

The second page is an interactive map, which displays the buildings as well as the types for the districts. It has the function of searching for address as well as the street view from the google map, helping you learn more about the Columbus Urban Structure. The search function will give details of the building information.

The third page is where the data reside (we use all data, including 12 building types within recent 9 years). It load sall the data we use on the page (only display those important columns), which will take several minutes to load (please allow that to happen). The subtitle of the bar chart is the place where you can link to the original website that we get the data from.

The bar chart is hiearchical bar chart with user interactions (the first layer is based on building type), where people can enter into a lower level visualization. The second layer is the comparison between data for single type of building within recent years (9 years). The drilldown and drillup function call will directly call the search function for the detail table below (which has more than 300000 data entries). For example, if you click on one bar (the commercial building type), the table will filter the commercial data points for you. The details table support the sortings functionsl for all columns as well as the searching functions, where you can enter a partial string for finding the information of a building. The column button above the detail table gives you the freedom of hiding or showing the columns. By clicking on the button, you can hide the button in such case. 

Note: the 2018 data is only for previous first 4 months 
We can not compare that in such with other years.
